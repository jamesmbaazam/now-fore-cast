# Impact of Data Quality on Forecasting Incidence of Cases: A Covid-19 Case Study

## Background:
The world is still recovering from Covid-19 pandemic that ravaged most countries in the world. Most of the countries which experienced the pandemic earlier have recovered especially in Europe and North-America, while most countries in Africa are dealing with post pandemic effects. The aim of this study is to find out how data quality impacts the analysis and forecasting of the Covid-19 reported cases progression. 

## Research Question:
What is the effect of data quality on forecasting accuracy? For example, how much does lower frequency reporting–weekly instead of daily–increase forecasting error (as measured by the difference between actual reported cases and predicted cases)?

## Data:
South Africa’s  daily confirmed Covid-19 cases from the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) collated by the Data Science for Social Impact Research Group @ University of Pretoria. Specifically, we will make use of daily South African provincial confirmed Covid-19 cases from 5 March 2020 to 25 July 2022.  The data contains daily reported cases and deaths for each province and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za/blob/master/data/covid19za_provincial_cumulative_timeline_confirmed.csv).

World Health Organization Covid-19 data on South Africa nationwide collected weekly. The [WHO weekly data](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/cases?m49=710&n=o) will be considered as the lower resolution (lower quality) data in our analyses.
